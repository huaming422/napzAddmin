Hi, Huaming Wang

I came across your profile while reviewing senior full-stack engineers with strong end-to-end ownership, and your experience stood out. Your track record of building scalable, high-quality web applications, optimizing performance, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams is exactly what we value at this stage.

We’re currently building a funded Web3 platform and are looking for a CTO to lead the technical direction—someone who can own architecture decisions, set engineering standards, and guide the platform as it scales. With an MVP already completed and long-term funding secured, this is a leadership role focused on execution, quality, and growth rather than early experimentation.

Your ability to deliver robust solutions in fast-paced environments, manage multiple initiatives, and maintain high code quality makes you a strong fit for this role. I believe you could have a real impact shaping both the product and the engineering culture.

If you are interested in this, contact with me on telegram or book a call using this link.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
